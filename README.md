# Communication through Reactome and Interactome (CoRe)

CoRe is a software package to construct communication network models for biological pathways, compute information transfer through the networks, and identify the biological processes affected by communication. CoRe uses the following databases:

- The Reactome database (https://reactome.org)
- The Interactome database (http://interactome.dfci.harvard.edu)
- The c5 collection in the MSigDB (http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb)
